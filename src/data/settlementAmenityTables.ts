// Transcribed from the B/X compilation's Appendix E: Random Settlement Builder — "Points of
// Interest" (docs/bx-appendix-cde-source.txt, ~lines 3164-3207). B/X/OSRIC integration, round 2,
// Phase 6 (the last of round 2) — see docs/plan-bx-osric-integration.md.
//
// This is a NEW settlement-level "civic amenities" list, additive to and separate from the
// existing per-district POI system (settlementTables.ts's DISTRICT_POI) — B/X has no district
// concept at all, so this doesn't replace anything, it layers a second, coarser-grained list on
// top. Settlement Size -> POI count/roll-range reuses the exact SettlementType mapping already
// established for Phase 3's population bands (Village->Village, Town->Small Town, City->Large
// Town, Metropolis->Major City — see settlementTables.ts's populationRangeForSettlementType).
