// Transcribed from the B/X compilation's Appendix C: Random Encounters — "Castle Encounters"
// (docs/bx-appendix-cde-source.txt, ~lines 1910-1933). B/X/OSRIC integration, round 2, Phase 3
// — see docs/plan-bx-osric-integration.md. Wired to this project's Keep site kind only (the
// book's "castle" is exactly what Keep already models: a fortified compound with a lord and a
// garrison) — Tower/Camp/Shrine/Rift/dungeon-shaped sites don't have an owner-with-a-reaction
// concept and are unaffected.
//
// The book gives no odds for which class owns a given castle — elves/dwarves/halflings are
// explicitly excluded ("their strongholds are special cases the DM should detail individually"),
// leaving only Fighter/Magic-User/Cleric. Picked uniformly here (1d3), a documented house-rule
// choice, same latitude as this project's other "book gives no die, DM's choice" gaps (e.g.
// Camp's central-feature placeholder).
