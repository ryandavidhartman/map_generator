// DungeonMapSvg.tsx, and only for Cave/Deep tunnels site types (Tomb/Ruins keep rectangular
// rendering, since built structures plausibly have straight walls where natural caves don't).
//
// Deliberately NOT part of the persisted generation model: Room.rect is unchanged, and this
// module is not Rng-injectable in the way engine/dungeonLayout.ts is. A room's blob shape is
// derived deterministically from its existing rect via a cheap seeded hash, so the same room
// always renders the same organic silhouette without needing new generated data or touching
// generateDungeonSite's rng stream (rerolling the site still rerolls rects as before; the blob
// wobble just follows wherever the new rect ends up).
