# OSR Hex Crawl Generator

A React web app implementing the overland hex-crawl generation system for OSR-style TTRPGs,
extended with house rules and OSR content. A GM starts a map on one hex and
clicks into adjacent unrevealed hexes to reveal them one at a time, rolling terrain, danger and
points of interest live. Points of interest open into generated sites (dungeons, settlements,
towers, keeps, camps, shrines, rifts), each with its own map, contents and on-demand rollers.

This file is the **current-state reference**. The dated build history (how each feature was
scoped, revised and verified) lives in `docs/history.md` — an archive of the old CLAUDE.md,
partly stale. Design docs, each the single source of truth for its area:

- `docs/plan-sites-settlements-mongo.md` — sites, settlements, encounters, Location Generator
  (its locked d200 Feature table is the source of truth for `locationTables.ts` — edit the doc
  first if that data changes), Mongo backend plan, neighbor-weighted terrain sketch.
- `docs/plan-osr-integration.md` — OSR content integration (rounds 1-2 + fixes).
- `docs/osr-appendix-cde-source.txt` — extracted OSR Appendix C/D/E source text.

**`docs/` is local-only (gitignored since 2026-11-01) — a fresh clone won't have it.** Nothing
in the app, tests or build reads it; it's the maintainer's design notes. Every `docs/...`
reference in this file and in code comments is background, not a requirement. Without the
folder, treat the code as the source of truth: edit the tables in `src/data/` directly (the
"edit the doc first" rules apply only where `docs/` exists), and record any new spec or
decision in code comments or this file rather than creating `docs/` files that won't be
committed.

## Status and roadmap

Done: overland hex crawl (unbounded map), 7 site kinds (dungeons in 4 types) with dedicated
views and maps (Shrine/Rift have no map), dungeon + settlement monster/NPC population, OSR
tables (treasure, traps, dressing, tricks, castles, equipment prices, civic amenities,
OSR dungeon monsters for room contents, wilderness + urban encounter rollers).

The faction system (and the propagation-rules plan built on it) was removed entirely on
2026-10-31 at the user's request — don't reintroduce factions without a fresh explicit ask.

### Punch list, in agreed order (updated 2026-10-31)

All campaigns/saves are test data — no migration or save-compatibility work is needed for the
user's own data.

**Done first (2026-11-01)**

0. ✅ **Replace all core-rulebook text with original text — done 2026-11-01** (user ask: remove
   the verbatim rulebook text, copyright-safe). Replaced: all 21 core d100 encounter tables
   (`docs/original-text-encounters.md` is now their source of truth — edit there first),
   every settlement table entry (district POIs, tavern/shop names, known-for, food, drinks with
   OSR-style effects, shop types, customers), the dungeon detail tables (trap/mob/solo word
   pairs, hazards, NPC, treasure, boss), and the 24 rulebook settlement names (rows 1-8 of each
   column; the user's rows 9-20 kept). Kept as generic labels: terrain, danger, site type/size,
   room type, district and settlement type names, and all dice structures. The guarded treasure
   result is now `TREASURE_GUARDED_DETAIL` ("Watched by a monster") in `dungeonTables.ts`.
   Page citations and quoted book text scrubbed from `docs/`. OSR/Basic Fantasy content and the
   user's own tables (Location Generator, Shrine, Rift, Camp) were out of scope. GitHub history
   was already squashed; the change just needs pushing.

**Core roadmap**

1. ✅ **Site map overhaul: Tower, Keep, Settlement, Camp all done** — moved to the top
   2026-10-31; the user judged the feature-site maps (towers, keeps, etc.) as needing a lot of
   improvement. Absorbs the old "classic-blue renderer rewrite for Settlement/Keep/Tower/Camp"
   item (Dungeon's classic-blue rewrite is done: blue-field / white-room two-tone). **Blocked on a
   reference image per site kind** (project rule: no visual revision without one; don't assume
   the dungeon scheme carries over). Still to clarify with the user: style only (renderer
   rewrite, like Dungeon's classic-blue pass), layout too (generator/layout changes — e.g. Tower as a
   stacked chain, Keep as a grid block don't read as real places), or both; and exactly which
   site kinds. Placed ahead of tracking because tracking's planned map markers (cleared/looted
   rooms) would otherwise be built twice, and any layout change alters generated data (do it
   before Mongo). While blocked, tracking proceeds without its map-marker part.
   ✅ **Tower — done 2026-10-31, browser-verified.** Reference:
   https://i.pinimg.com/1200x/d5/12/40/d5124032d9495aa2a26f8881308a7a5c.jpg (side-view tower
   beside stacked top-down plans). Decisions: side view + per-floor plans; black line art on
   white (deliberately not the dungeon's blue/white); schematic, not illustrated, side view; no
   furniture icons (possible later polish); all floors shown at once, click a floor to
   highlight it; no basement/gatehouse plan. The Feature table's "Small tower" rows were
   renamed "Tower" (user chose size variety over the book's "small"). Details in the
   Architecture section's Tower notes.
   ✅ **Keep — done 2026-10-31, browser-verified.** Reference: the "abandoned keep" image by
   arnnormand on DeviantArt (wixmp URL in this session's history; also used for the July
   walled-compound revision) — walled compound with square towers and a gatehouse, a keep
   building of rooms sharing walls, plus its upper floor and cellar. Decisions: match the
   tower's black-on-white style; include upper floors and a cellar (user asked for both).
   Details in the Architecture section's Keep notes.
   ✅ **Settlement — done 2026-10-31, browser-verified** (step 1, shape variety, sea/river
   edges, suburbs). Full spec, user decisions and both references:
   `docs/plan-settlement-map-overhaul.md`. Unlike Tower/Keep it's a **color** map (user's
   choice). **User rule for water: it must make sense for the hex the settlement is in** —
   implemented as `settlementPlan.ts`'s `waterForHex` (rules table in the plan doc): coast
   toward Ocean neighbors (or a random side for an Ocean hex with none revealed), a river for a
   River/coast hex with no Ocean neighbor, otherwise nothing.
   ✅ **Camp — done 2026-10-31, browser-verified.** Color, painted forest-clearing style;
   reference and decisions in `docs/plan-camp-map-overhaul.md`. Drawing-only: generateCamp.ts
   and its stored positions are untouched.
   ⬜ **Tombs, Ruins, Temples — visual style updates needed** (user ask 2026-11-01). Tomb and
   Ruins are dungeon types drawn by `DungeonMapSvg.tsx` (currently the shared classic-blue
   rect style). "Temple" in the Feature table is either `Temple (oracle)` (d200 84-87 → Shrine,
   which has **no map** today) or `Ruins (temple)` (→ Ruins dungeon) — **user: both**
   (2026-11-01). So the Temple (oracle) Shrine needs a brand-new map, not just a restyle.
   Blocked on a reference image per kind; confirm style-only vs. layout too.
2. **Site-interaction tracking** — next. A typed
   per-site event log at room/feature level (monster defeated, treasure looted, NPC
   killed/recruited/talked to, door forced), not freeform notes, so a revisited site reflects
   what the party did there. Event-triggered by party interaction, not a GM "advance time"
   button. Scope questions to confirm first: which
   event types (core set + "room explored"/"trap triggered"/GM note?), which site kinds
   (dungeon-shaped first?), how events show (mark contents cleared/looted vs. a per-room log),
   undo, and what Reroll Site does to an existing log. Kept ahead of Mongo deliberately: it
   changes the saved schema, and this project sequences schema changes before Mongo; the whole
   `MapState` is one JSON document, so moving it to Mongo later is cheap.
3. **Mongo backend + multi-campaign persistence** — reuses the user's existing Atlas cluster
   with a new database (plan doc's "Reuse note"). Open questions: client/server TypeScript
   type sharing across two tsconfigs (unverified), and hosting / SPA route fallback (no deploy
   target chosen). Would jump the queue if multi-campaign/multi-device play is needed soon or
   localStorage (~5 MB) fills up.
4. **Neighbor-weighted terrain** — new-hex terrain influenced by all revealed neighbors, Ocean
   forming contiguous bodies.

**Polish (can slot in anywhere)**

5. **Encounter rollers for dungeon sites + the Tavern table** — the Cave/Deep
   Tunnels/Ruins d100 tables and the Tavern d100 table exist but are reachable from no UI.
   `DungeonSiteView` has no encounter roller at all; `SITE_TYPE_TO_ENCOUNTER_KEY`
   (`encounterTables.ts`, Tomb → Ruins since the book has no Tomb table) exists but is only
   referenced by its test. Reuse `EncounterRoller`.
6. **Avoid duplicate room detail text within one dungeon** — reroll once on an exact match
   (book RAW allows duplicates; pure variety improvement).
7. **Profession-aware NPC activity tier** — `npcTables.ts`'s 1d5 tier is independent of
   profession (e.g. "Dwarf Labourer — Infirm"). Only if it bothers the user in play.

**Blocked on content from the user** (item 1 is also blocked on reference images)

8. **Encounter tables for Tower/Shrine/Rift/Keep/Camp** — none exist yet.
9. **Camp central-feature table** — currently a generic placeholder.

Deliberately not built: a turn-clock state machine; OSR's full procedural dungeon crawler; NPC
adventuring parties; combat stat blocks (name/flavor only — real stats are a future Mongo
feature); map export; undo.

## Working rules for this project

- **Verbatim tables.** Book/OSR/user-supplied tables are transcribed verbatim. Any non-verbatim
  addition (e.g. a selector die the source doesn't give) is called out in that file's header
  comment. When the user pastes table/spec content, save it to a file in `docs/` immediately.
- **Visual revisions start from a reference image** the user supplies, fetched and actually
  viewed, with scope confirmed against it before code. Look critically at your own screenshots —
  several real rendering bugs were only caught that way.
- **Rendering derives from persisted data.** Visual-only changes (cave blobs, keep walls, door
  placement) compute shapes at render time from existing generated data (`rect`, connections),
  never by adding persisted fields or changing a generator's rng stream.
- **Cross-axis validity.** When a model has independent rolled axes, check that combinations
  make sense, not just that each field type-checks (e.g. a Boss Monster that rolls a giant
  ferret, or an NPC's activity tier clashing with their profession).
- **Schema growth.** `MapContext.tsx`'s `initMapState` merges a loaded save over
  `EMPTY_MAP_STATE`, so new top-level `MapState` fields get defaults. A field that's present but
  needs content needs an explicit backfill there. Per-hex fields aren't covered by the merge.
- Don't commit unless asked.
- **License: CC BY-SA 4.0** (`LICENSE`, README "License" section), chosen 2026-11-01 to match
  Basic Fantasy RPG 4th Edition. Credit any newly adapted Basic Fantasy material in the README's
  Attribution section. Don't name any other game, publisher or rulebook anywhere in the project — say
  "core rules" or "OSR" instead (user rule, 2026-11-01).

## Stack and environment gotchas

- **Node 20.16.0** (`.nvmrc`). Run `source ~/.nvm/nvm.sh && nvm use` before npm commands.
  Node 18 can't run current Vite tooling.
- **Vite 6.4 + Vitest 4.1, Rollup-based — don't jump to Vite 8.** Vite 8 defaults to the
  Rolldown bundler whose native binding fails to load here. Vite 7 needs Node >= 20.19.
- React 18, `react-router-dom` 7 (`BrowserRouter` in `main.tsx`). No linter configured.
  `npm audit` clean as of 2026-10-29.
- Geometry dep: `d3-delaunay` (Voronoi). `polygon-clipping` was removed 2026-10-31 with the
  settlement overhaul (all clipping is now convex half-plane clipping in `settlementPlan.ts`).
  If it's ever re-added: its `.d.ts` declares named exports but the ESM bundle only has a
  default export, so named imports typecheck but are `undefined` at runtime.

## Commands

```bash
source ~/.nvm/nvm.sh && nvm use   # Node 20.16.0
npm install
npm run dev        # http://localhost:5173
npm run test       # Vitest (515 tests as of 2026-10-31)
npm run build      # tsc -b && vite build
npx tsc -b         # typecheck only
```

## Architecture

Layering: `data/` = single tables and lookups (pure; book/OSR/user-supplied tables are
verbatim); `engine/` = assembling a whole generated thing; `hexgrid/` = SVG geometry and
renderers; `state/` = reducer and context; `components/` and `routes/` = UI. Every roll takes
an injectable `Rng` (`engine/dice.ts`), so generators are seed-testable.

### Routes (`App.tsx`)

- `/` — overland map.
- `/hex/:hexId` — full view of one hex (`HexDetailPage` → `HexSiteContent`).
- `/poi/:n` (n = 1-200) — GM review tool: force-generates Feature-table row *n* in a throwaway,
  non-persisting `MapProvider`. Has terrain + danger-level selectors, Reroll POI, Prev/Next.
  The fastest way to browser-check any site kind (e.g. `/poi/25` = Tomb, `/poi/88` = Ruins,
  `/poi/14`-`19` = Keep, `/poi/150` = Village, `/poi/200` = Metropolis).

### State (`state/`)

- `mapReducer.ts` — `MapState = { hexes, partyHexId, selectedHexId }`. Actions:
  `START_MAP`, `MOVE_PARTY_TO`, `SELECT_HEX`, `REROLL_HEX`, `EDIT_HEX`, `GENERATE_SITE`,
  `REROLL_SITE`, `NEW_MAP`.
  - `Hex` has qualitative `danger` (book roll) plus numeric **`dangerLevel`** (house rule:
    rounded average of revealed neighbors' `dangerLevel`, shifted by this hex's own `danger`,
    floor 1; the starting hex is 1 — `computeHexDangerLevel`). This replaced the old
    campaign-wide `partyLevel`. It drives wilderness/urban encounter gating and, via
    `dungeonTables.ts`'s `effectiveDungeonLevel`, dungeon-shaped site contents.
  - `MOVE_PARTY_TO` only succeeds into a hex adjacent to the party (no map bound). New hexes
    roll fresh; revealed ones just relocate the party.
  - `GENERATE_SITE` is idempotent; `REROLL_SITE` regenerates unconditionally. `REROLL_HEX` and
    `EDIT_HEX` (when touching `poi`) clear the now-stale `site`.
- `MapContext.tsx` — context + `useReducer`; lazy-inits from localStorage with the merge
  described in "Working rules". Optional `initialState`/`persist` props let
  `/poi/:n` run an isolated reducer.
- `persistence/localStorage.ts` — single save under `osr-hex-crawl:map`; fails silently.

### Overland (`data/tables.ts`, `data/locationTables.ts`, `engine/generateHex.ts`)

- `tables.ts`: terrain order + circular stepping, Hex Terrain 2d6, New Hex 2d6, Danger d6,
  Settlement Name d20 × 3 columns (City and Metropolis share a name pool via
  `settlementNameColumnFor`), and `SETTLEMENT_LOCATIONS` (legacy dispatch for manually-edited
  POIs).
- `locationTables.ts`: house-rule **Location Generator** — d200 Feature table
  (`locationFeatureForD200`) plus terrain-keyed Cataclysm and Natural Landmark tables. Each row
  yields a `siteKind` (or `'none'` for cataclysm/landmark flavor) and optional `forcedType`
  (e.g. a Metropolis POI forces the Settlement Type roll).
- `generateHex.ts`: `rollPointOfInterest` (1-in-6 gate, then d200, reusing the hex's own
  terrain) and `pointOfInterestForFeatureRoll` (no gate — used by `/poi/:n`).
- `engine/generateSite.ts`: `generateSiteForHex` switches on `poi.siteKind` and passes
  `forcedType` through. `siteKind === undefined` falls back to the `SETTLEMENT_LOCATIONS`
  heuristic; `'none'` → no site (and `HexSiteContent` never dispatches `GENERATE_SITE`).

### Site kinds

| Kind | Generator | Layout | Renderer / view |
|---|---|---|---|
| Dungeon (Cave/Tomb/Deep tunnels/Ruins) | `generateDungeon.ts` | `dungeonLayout.ts` (BSP) | `DungeonMapSvg.tsx` |
| Settlement (Village/Town/City/Metropolis) | `generateSettlement.ts` | `settlementPlan.ts` (render-time) | `SettlementMapSvg.tsx` (color) |
| Tower | `generateTower.ts` | `towerPlan.ts` (render-time) | `TowerMapSvg.tsx` (side view + floor plans) |
| Keep | `generateKeep.ts` | `keepPlan.ts` (render-time) | `KeepMapSvg.tsx` (compound + floor plans) |
| Camp | `generateCamp.ts` | `campLayout.ts` + `campPlan.ts` (render-time) | `CampMapSvg.tsx` (color) |
| Shrine | `generateShrine.ts` | none | `ShrineSiteView` (scene cards) |
| Rift | `generateRift.ts` | none | `RiftSiteView` (one block) |

Views live in `components/hexdetail/*SiteView.tsx` (plus `WildernessView`), selected by
`HexSiteContent.tsx`. Key rules per kind:

- **Dungeon.** Site Type/Size are rolled fresh, never derived from POI text (unless forced by
  the POI row). `dungeonLayout.ts` splits a rectangle into exactly `roomCount` rects
  (`MIN_ROOM_DIM = 4`, `roomCount - 1` rng calls); connections = rects sharing an axis-aligned
  boundary segment (a graph, not a tree). Objective room = highest Room Type roll, first wins
  ties. Also rolls a `dungeonLevel` from the site's danger, and a d10 Scenario line.
- **Shared room contents** (`roomContent.ts`): `rollRoomContent(rng, effectiveDungeonLevel)` —
  Room Type d10 + detail sub-tables + attachments. Monster room types roll a real OSR creature
  via `generateDungeonEncounter.ts` → `dungeonMonsterLevelTables.ts` (Monster Sub-table Matrix:
  dungeon level → Monster Level → d% creature) with a Treasure Type from
  `monsterTreasureTypes.ts`/`treasureTypeTables.ts`. Treasure rooms use `generateTreasure.ts`
  (OSR Tables 9-12; the guarded result, "Watched by a monster", rolls Amount twice). Trap rooms use `trapTables.ts`
  with a severity derived from dungeon level. NPC rooms use `monsterTables.ts` (now only NPC
  archetypes — the old invented monster/category system is gone).
  `rollBiasedRoomContent` gives one extra roll toward desired types (Keep's Armory and Lord's
  Quarters). Tower and Keep reuse this.
- **Settlement.** Settlement Type (d6) gives a dice pool — Village 3d4, Town 4d4, City 6d6,
  Metropolis 8d8. The number of dice is the district count (**never summed**), and each die's
  face indexes that district's type, so d4 settlements can only reach the first 4 of 8 district
  types. This tiering is intentional RAW; don't "fix" it. The generator stores game content
  only (no geometry). `settlementPlan.ts` derives the map at render time from the districts
  plus a seeded hash. Each settlement rolls an outline (round / angular with corner bastions /
  elongated along its main road) and a street pattern (organic / planned grid with avenues
  crossing at the center / grid core with organic outskirts / old town inside an inner wall),
  odds by size (villages: organic, never angular). ~24-110 blocks (by type) in a convex
  outline — Voronoi cells, organic ones smoothed with Lloyd's relaxation; the game districts
  are groups of neighboring blocks, seat at the center
  (a plaza, or a castle for a Castle District seat); streets are the gaps between blocks, main
  roads the shortest gate-to-center routes along block edges (wider gaps); blocks sliced into
  street-facing lots (polygon subdivision), interior scraps become yards; gardens, temples and
  roof palettes by district type; a towered wall with gates for Town+, while villages are
  unwalled houses along their roads with fields between. Water (`waterForHex`, fed by
  `SettlementView` from the hex's terrain and its revealed neighbors' directions): a coast cuts
  the outline on the sea side (no wall there, gates on the land side, a harbor road and
  piers); a river splits blocks along its banks, with bridges the main roads use and water
  gaps in the wall. Suburbs (Town+): houses along the roads out of some gates (Town 1-2, City
  2-3, Metropolis all), thinning with distance, kept off the water and clear of fields. Each
  district POI is
  `{text, npc}` with `npc` from `npcTables.ts` (OSR Appendix C Urban: race, profession, noble
  class, plus a 1d5 activity tier — the one non-verbatim addition). Also rolls government
  and population, plus civic amenities (`generateCivicAmenities.ts`, OSR Appendix E,
  `CivicAmenitiesPanel`). Static prices in `PricesPanel` (`equipmentTables.ts`).
  `generateTavern`/`generateShop` are ephemeral, re-rollable, not persisted.
- **Tower.** Floor count from the Size roll (Small 2-3, Medium 4-5, Large 6-7 — never fewer
  than 2 floors, user rule 2026-10-31). Ground floor = entry hall + guard room. Each floor
  above has a stair landing (`floorRoomIndex` 0, id `level-N`) plus side rooms (middle floors d3
  rooms in total, top floor d2); side rooms open
  only onto their own landing, and landings chain floor to floor, so the climb stays linear.
  Objective is **hard-coded on the top floor's landing** (a deliberate exception, avoiding an
  anticlimactic walk-back). `towerPlan.ts` derives each floor's drawing at render time from
  the room list plus a seeded hash: a round core that stays the same width or narrows going up
  (user rule, 2026-10-31; only exception: ~15% of towers get a flared, wider top floor),
  extra rooms either as wall partitions (halves/quarters) or rectangular annexes, a curved
  stair inside the landing, door positions, and the ground floor's entrance walkway opposite
  the guard-room annex.
  `TowerMapSvg` draws a schematic side view beside one plan per floor, black on white.
- **Keep.** Rooms carry a `floor` (-1 cellar, 0 ground, 1+ upper). Ground floor: the Courtyard
  (room 1, outdoors) plus building rooms by Size (3-4/5-6/7-8; Hall, Barracks, Armory, then
  generic). Upper floors: 1 (Small/Medium) or 2 (Large), d3+1 rooms each, the top one led by
  the Lord's Quarters. Cellar: always, d3+1 rooms (Storeroom, Cells, then generic). Normal
  highest-roll objective. Castle owner/reaction block from `castleTables.ts`. `keepPlan.ts`
  derives the drawing at render time from the room list plus a seeded hash: one building
  footprint shared by every floor, each floor's rooms packed into it with
  `dungeonLayout.ts`'s `partitionRect` (first room gets the largest space; the footprint grows
  until every floor fits), doors on a spanning tree of shared walls, an octagonal stair turret
  on a top corner, and the ground floor's walled compound (curtain wall, square towers,
  gatehouse, building entrance, open yard). `KeepMapSvg` draws the compound, then the upper
  floors and cellar in a row below, black on white like the tower.
- **Camp.** Central feature + peripheral features, **no connections by design**; no danger roll;
  objective = "Ritual/leader's space" if rolled, else the central feature. `campPlan.ts` draws it
  at render time as a forest clearing: positions from `campLayout.ts` pulled in around the fire
  (only as far as features stay clear of each other), each feature type drawn as its own scene
  (fire + log seats; tents + bedrolls; crates/barrels/sacks + wagon; watch platform + stakes;
  fenced pen + horses + hay; grated pit; leader's tent + rug + banner), forest band on one side,
  white-paper fade on the other, map kept roughly square.
- **Shrine / Rift.** No topology. Shrine: d3 features, core feature is the objective. Rift:
  exactly 3 independent rolls (Origin/Effect/Stability).

### On-demand rollers (not part of any site's deterministic rng stream)

- `EncounterRoller` — mounted in `HexBaseInfo` (wilderness: Terrain table, or OSR
  wandering monster gated by the terrain's 1d6 frequency check) and per district in
  `SettlementView` (District table, or OSR Daytime/Nighttime urban tables gated by
  `hexDangerLevel`). One mutually-exclusive source dropdown; every result adds an Encounter
  Purpose d8 line. Not mounted on any other site kind (see punch-list item 5).
- `DressingRoller` (5 OSR sensory tables) and `TrickRoller` — in Dungeon, Tower and Keep views.
- Tavern/Shop generators — per district in `SettlementView`.

Engine: `rollEncounter.ts` (`rollEncounter`, `checkWildernessEncounterFrequency`,
`rollWildernessMonster` via `wildernessMonsterLevelTables.ts`, `rollOsrUrbanEncounter`).

### Overland map rendering (`hexgrid/`)

`hexMath.ts` — axial coords, flat-top layout, `computeVisibleCoords` (revealed hexes + their
unrevealed neighbors; no map size). `HexGridSvg.tsx` — hand-rolled pan/zoom via viewBox; the
initial fit is computed once at mount (lazy `useState`) and deliberately not recomputed as the
frontier grows, so reveals don't yank the camera. `HexTile.tsx` — fill = terrain, stroke =
danger; **single click moves the party (250 ms debounce), double click opens `/hex/:id`**.

### Site renderer notes

- `DungeonMapSvg.tsx` — Classic two-tone: solid blue field (`CLASSIC_BLUE`) = rock, `floor-grid` pattern =
  floor, walls are just a blue stroke. Cave/Deep tunnels: organic blobs and winding corridors
  derived deterministically from each room's `rect` (`caveRenderShapes.ts`). Tomb/Ruins: rects
  inset by `RECT_ROOM_INSET_UNITS` (0.15), and each connection is a **door rect bridging the
  shared wall** (found via `rectAdjacency`), not a corridor line — connected rooms always share
  an exact edge, so any drawn gap is artificial. Room markers are small circles colored by room
  type with the room number; the objective gets a star "statue" icon.
- `SettlementMapSvg.tsx` — color painted-map style. Draw order: countryside fields → roads out
  of the gates → trees → town ground (street color) → blocks/lots → district borders → district
  click regions → wall/towers/gates → markers. Streets aren't drawn; they're the ground showing
  between blocks (villages draw their main roads explicitly instead).

## Don't reintroduce (all passed typecheck and build)

1. `setPointerCapture` on the map SVG's pointerdown breaks click delivery to hex tiles in
   Chromium. Pan works without it.
2. React's `onWheel` is passive, so `preventDefault` no-ops. Wheel zoom uses a native
   `addEventListener('wheel', ..., { passive: false })` in a `useEffect`.
3. `#root` needs a definite height (`html, body { height: 100% }`, `#root { height: 100svh }`),
   not `min-height`, or the SVG's `height: 100%` can't resolve and the page inflates.
4. Rendering-order bugs: roads under opaque districts, corridors hidden under rooms, corridor
   spurs from center-to-center lines. Check z-order and endpoint clipping when touching
   renderers.
5. Scripted-rng tests desync silently if one intermediate value is wrong (e.g. Room Type d10
   roll 2 = Empty, 3 = Trap). Prefer seeded + structural assertions for anything with
   rejection sampling.

## Verifying UI changes in a browser

Typecheck and tests aren't enough for UI work — drive a real browser. Playwright isn't a
project dependency: install `playwright` in a scratch dir (one existed at
`/tmp/pw-scratch/node_modules/playwright` as of 2026-10-31 — `/tmp` may be wiped), run
`npx playwright install chromium` if the cached browser doesn't match, and launch with
`chromium.launch({ args: ['--no-sandbox'] })` from a plain Node 20 script against
`npm run dev`.

- Hexes carry `data-hex-id="q,r"` on their `<g>` — click the `<g>`, not the `<polygon>` (POI
  markers cover the center). Wait ~300 ms after `.click()` (debounce); use `.dblclick()` to open
  details.
- Site maps carry `data-room-id`, `data-district-id` or `data-feature-id`.
- Use `/poi/:n` to reach any site kind directly, or seed
  `localStorage['osr-hex-crawl:map']` for map-state scenarios.
- Collect `console` errors and `pageerror`s; expect zero. Take a screenshot and actually look
  at it.
